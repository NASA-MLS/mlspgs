  ! ---------------------------------------------  FindIntersection  -----
  ! This family of routines finds the indices of the intersection between
  ! two similarly montonic sets
  ! e.g. given set1 = /(1, 3, 5, 7 )/, set2 = /(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)/
  ! produces which1 = /(1, 2, 3)/, 
  !      which2 = /(1, 3, 5)/, 
  ! and the optional arg      how_many = 3
  
  ! Note that which1 and which2 are arrays of array indices
  ! and that they will be monotonic, too
  
  ! (Actually, set1 and set2 may be non-monotonic as long as each value is
  ! unique within its own set)
  ! subroutine FindIntersectionInteger ( set1, set2, WHICH1, which2, HOW_MANY )
  !   ! Formal arguments

  !   integer, dimension(:), intent(out)    :: which2
  !   integer, optional, intent(out)        :: how_many
  ! Internal variables
  ! integer                               :: myTol
  ! integer :: i1, i2
