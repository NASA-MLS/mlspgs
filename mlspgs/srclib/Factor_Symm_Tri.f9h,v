    ! Factor a symmetric tridiagonal matrix

    ! There are at least two ways to LU factor a symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
    ! The one with ones on the diagonal of U (the Crout factorization) is
    ! simple to compute:

    ! The subdiagonal of L is H, the subdiagonal of the matrix.
    ! The diagonal elements of L follow the simple recurrence
    ! \beta_1 = d_1
    ! \beta_i = d_i - h_i^2 / \beta_{i-1}

    ! The diagonal elements of U are 1
    ! The i'th superdiagonal element, where i indexes the row, is
    ! h_i / \beta_i.

    ! The one with ones on the diagonal of L (the Doolittle factorization) is
    ! also simple to compute, but I had to choose only one of them, and I
    ! chose Crout.

    real(rk), intent(in) :: DIAG(:) ! (1:n) Diagonal of the matrix
    real(rk), intent(in) :: H(:)    ! (1:n-1) is the super- and subdiagonal
    real(rk), intent(out) :: D(:)   ! (1:n) Inverse of diagonal of L
                                    ! Subdiagonal of L is H(1:n-1)
    real(rk), intent(out) :: U(:)   ! (1:n-1) Superdiagonal of U
