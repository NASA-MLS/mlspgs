! function HuntBox_r4 ( GRIDPOINTS, MGRIDPOINTS, COORDS, INDICES, VERTICES )
    ! We assume the grid is laid out as a rectangular lattice
    ! There are n dimensions
    ! Along each k of the n dimensions are m[k] points which are
    ! essentially the tick marks on the axis for that dimension
    ! So Gridpoints is dimensioned (max(m[k]), n)
    ! mGridPoints is a longer name for m
    ! Try to find the n-dimensional box bounding the particular set coords
    !
    ! We'll just do that for each of the n dimensions--not too hard
    ! since we can use purehunt
