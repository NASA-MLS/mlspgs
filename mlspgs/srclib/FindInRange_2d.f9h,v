    ! subroutine FindInRange_2d_r4 ( list, vrange, which, how_many, options )
    ! Return all pairs of indices at which
    ! values of list are within vrange, inclusive
    ! E.g., list( which(1, i), which(2, i) ) for i = 1 .. how_many
    ! If none, return (/ 0, .., 0 /)
    ! Special interpretation: inclusive means
    ! if vrange(1) == vrange(2), any values of list also == vrange
    ! are within that range
    ! Unlike Hunt, list need not be monotonic
    ! options may include any of the following characters
    !    character            meaning
    !    ---------            -------
    !       a                 ignore sign
    !       r                 reverse sense (i.e. find outside range)
    !       c                 (not applicable; issue warning)
    ! Note: reversing sense reverses special interpretation, too
    ! so if vrange(1) == vrange(2), will count only values of list /= vrange
    ! I hope that's clear
