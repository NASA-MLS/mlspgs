! subroutine Factor_Symm_Tri_inPlace_r* ( D, H, U )
    ! Factor a symmetric tridiagonal matrix

    ! There are at least two ways to LU factor a symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
    ! The one with ones on the diagonal of U (the Crout factorization) is
    ! simple to compute:

    ! The subdiagonal of L is H, the subdiagonal of the matrix.
    ! The diagonal elements of L follow the simple recurrence
    ! \beta_1 = d_1
    ! \beta_i = d_i - h_i^2 / \beta_{i-1}

    ! The diagonal elements of U are 1
    ! The i'th superdiagonal element, where i indexes the row, is
    ! h_i / \beta_i.

    ! The one with ones on the diagonal of L (the Doolittle factorization) is
    ! also simple to compute, but I had to choose only one of them, and I
    ! chose Crout.

    real(rk), intent(inout) :: D(:) ! (1:n) Diagonal of the matrix on input,
                                    ! Inverse of diagonal of L on output
                                    ! Subdiagonal of L is H(1:n-1)
    real(rk), intent(in) :: H(:)    ! (1:n-1) Super- and subdiagonal of input
    real(rk), intent(out) :: U(:)   ! (1:n-1) Superdiagonal of U

    integer :: K, N

    n = size(d)

    d(1) = 1.0 / d(1)
    do k = 2, n
      u(k-1) = h(k-1) * d(k-1)
      d(k) = 1.0 / ( d(k) - h(k-1) * u(k-1) )
    end do
