    '''Function that handles prompting for array-like data (e.g. molecule = [...])
    Such data may have arrays within arrays, e.g. 

    molecules = [ EXTINCTIONV2, $                         
    [ HNO3, HNO3, HNO3_V7, HNO3_V9 ], $

    [ SO2, S_32_O2 ] ] 

    The function returns a list: (True|False, string). The first element
    is True if the parsing worked, False otherwise.The second element is
    the string you would append to the statement 'molecule = ' in the
    forwardModel line
