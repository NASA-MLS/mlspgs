* Compilation Errors

** no matching specific subroutine for this generic subroutine call
   ../mockup.f90(983): error #6285: There is no matching specific subroutine for this generic subroutine call.   [ALLOCATE_TEST]
   CALL Allocate_Test(signal,1,subroutineName,'signal')

  You're trying to allocate something (like a user defined type) that
  doesn't have a generic function. Normally, for a usertype, you
  allocate the individual parts of it, e.g.

  TYPE(SpectrometerType_T) :: SpectrometerType
  
  call Allocate_Test ( spectrometerType%frequencies, last, &
  & 'spectrometerType%frequencies', SubroutineName, lowBound = first )


** Array name is invalid in this context

   Originally got this when the offending statement was...
   TYPE (Module_T),DIMENSION(:),intent(inout) :: modules ! the modules database   

   Changed it to

   TYPE (Module_T),intent(inout) :: modules(:) ! the modules database

   But got the same error


** The assignment operation or the binary expression operation is invalid for the data types of the two operands.
../mockup.f90(916): error #6303: The assignment operation or the binary expression operation is invalid for the data types of the two operands.   [TRIM]
  radiometer%Polarization = trim(Polarization)
