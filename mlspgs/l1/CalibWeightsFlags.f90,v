    ! Loop over the data in the two temporary files, engMAF_tmp.dat and
    ! sciMAF_tmp.dat. These two loops try to match eng and sci MAFs and write
    ! data to a permanent file described before, which I'll call the L1BENG
    ! file. The outer reads an engineering MAF, the inner tries to find its
    ! matching science MAF. At each step it writes data to the L1BENG
    ! file. There are three cases: 1) The MAF numbers agree and the eng MAF is
    ! within 0.5 and 1.5 MAF durations away from the science MAF time; 2) the
    ! MAF numbers don't agree (most likely) or the times are out of range, and
    ! the engineering time is <= science time; 3) the MAF numbers don't agree
    ! (or the time is out of spec) and engineering time is > science time. In 1)
    ! it declares a match, writes some science data to the permanent file, exits
    ! the inner loop and reads the next eng MAF and exits the inner loop. In 2)
    ! is writes some default science values to L1BENG file and reads the next
    ! Eng MAF and writes _that_ data to the L1BENG file and continues to the
    ! next iteration of the inner loop (which will read the next science
    ! MAF). In 3) it reads the next science MAF, calculates position info and
    ! continues to next iteration of the inner loop.

    ! When a match has been found, the following is calculated.  
    !
    ! 1) The switching mirror 'type' (i.e. which MIFs are 'L', 'S', 'T' or 'D'
    ! MIFs)
    ! 2) The DACS TPs
    ! 3) The scan angles

    ! 4) Calibration weight flags.(See the WeightsFlags user type)

    !    4.1) These flags tell whether the weights for entire MAF has to be
    !    recalculated because the number of MIFs has changed. (recomp_MAF)
    ! 
    !    4.2) Whether the MIFs declared to be 'S'pace MIFs need to be
    !    recalculated because there's a different number of Space MIFs than the
    !    previous MAF (recomp_S)
    !
    !    4.3) Whether the MIFs declared to be 'T'arget MIFs need to be
    !    recalculated because there's a different number of Target MIFs than the
    !    previous MAF (recomp_T)
    !
    !  5) Calculates the TPz values (for MLSL1G)

    !in IDL, this is mindx=where(GHz_seq eq 'S', sum_S) GHz_seq is a character

    !discarded, a 'L' with a limb scan in it, a 'S' or 'T' for space and
    !calibration target, respectively. 

    !GHz_seq => L1Config%Calib%GHz_seq. This is read from the .cf file and tells
    !what MIFs are what type: "L" = limb, 'S' = space, 'T' = target and 'D' =
    !discard. 

    !GHz_seq_use => L1Config%Calib%GHz_seq_use: also read from .cf file, tells
    !you what to do with them. If 'M'atch then the telemetry must match what's
    !in the .cf. If 'O'verride, the data will override the .cf file.

    ! Loop over the data in the two temporary files, engMAF_tmp.dat and
    ! sciMAF_tmp.dat. These two loops try to match eng and sci MAFs and write
    ! data to a permanent file described before, which I'll call the L1BENG
    ! file. The outer reads an engineering MAF, the inner tries to find its
    ! matching science MAF. At each step it writes data to the L1BENG
    ! file. There are three cases: 1) The MAF numbers agree and the eng MAF is
    ! within 0.5 and 1.5 MAF durations away from the science MAF time; 2) the
    ! MAF numbers don't agree (most likely) or the times are out of range, and
    ! the engineering time is <= science time; 3) the MAF numbers don't agree
    ! (or the time is out of spec) and engineering time is > science time. In 1)
    ! it declares a match, writes some science data to the permanent file, exits
    ! the inner loop and reads the next eng MAF and exits the inner loop. In 2)
    ! is writes some default science values to L1BENG file and reads the next
    ! Eng MAF and writes _that_ data to the L1BENG file and continues to the
    ! next iteration of the inner loop (which will read the next science
    ! MAF). In 3) it reads the next science MAF, calculates position info and
    ! continues to next iteration of the inner loop.

    ! When a match has been found, the following is calculated.  
    !
    ! 1) The switching mirror 'type' (i.e. which MIFs are 'L', 'S', 'T' or 'D'
    ! MIFs)
    ! 2) The DACS TPs
    ! 3) The scan angles

    ! 4) Calibration weight flags.(See the WeightsFlags user type)

    !    4.1) These flags tell whether the weights for entire MAF has to be
    !    recalculated because the number of MIFs has changed. (recomp_MAF)
    ! 
    !    4.2) Whether the MIFs declared to be 'S'pace MIFs need to be
    !    recalculated because there's a different number of Space MIFs than the
    !    previous MAF (recomp_S)
    !
    !    4.3) Whether the MIFs declared to be 'T'arget MIFs need to be
    !    recalculated because there's a different number of Target MIFs than the
    !    previous MAF (recomp_T)
    !
    !  5) Calculates the TPz values (for MLSL1G)
