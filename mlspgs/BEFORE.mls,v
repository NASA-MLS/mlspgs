NOTE
It is possible that you won't need to read this document. If you obtained the
mls software as part of a shrinkwrap package, look there for the files build or
build-xxx (where xxx might be "nag"), env.linux, and f90. After judiciously
editing these, just cd to their directory and type "build[-xxx]".

SUMMARY
Before building the mls software you will need the following
 (1) f95 compiler (NAG, Lahey, or Sun)
 (2) Installed SDP Toolkit libraries:
    (a) PGSTK
    (b) HDFEOS
    (c) HDF
    .. .. ..
 (3) mls software (probably where you're reading this)
 (4) PVM--a library to emulate parallel virtual machines
 (5) FFTW--a library to accomplish fast Fourier tranforms
 (6) BLAS and LAPACK--libraries to speed up linear algebra

The first step is to find out if you already have (1)-(6). If you do, you may
safely ignore the rest of this guide. Obtaining (1), (3), and (6) is not
within the scope of this guide, although if you are reading it online, you
probably already have (3).

The rest of this guide focuses on how to obtain (2), (5), and (6). After reading
it you will probably want to read README.MakeFC or else type 
'make -f MakeFC disthelp'.

CONTENTS
I     SUMMARY
II    CONTENTS
III   THE SDP TOOLKIT
IV    PVM
V     FFTW
VI    BLAS
VII   LAPACK

THE SDP TOOLKIT
The distribution to build the libraries and ancillary files making up the SDP
Toolkit can be found at 
	http://edhs1.gsfc.nasa.gov/
It comes with instructions for building it for a number of supported platforms.
Additional information on how to build it for the linux OS can be found at
	http://www.met.ed.ac.uk/~hcp/hdfeos_notes.txt

After building this successfully, keep careful note of its location. An easy
way to do this is to source pgs-env.csh or pgs-dev-env.csh in your login shell,
assuming you use the csh or tcsh shells. That automatically defines other
environment variables that will make configuring the mls software easier:
	HDFEOS_LIB
	HDFEOS5_LIB
	HDFLIB
	HDF5LIB
	PGSLIB
   ZLIBHOME
   SZIPHOME
If you get the latest version of the toolkit, you will automatically build these
added libraries. They are all needed for correctly building the mls software.

PVM
The distribution to build the libraries and ancillary files making up the PVM
software system can be found at 
	http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/index.html
in particular the file: http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/pvm3.4.3.tgz

It comes with instructions for building for a unix-style platforms. In brief,
after downloading the file, say to your home directory, issue the following
commands
	gunzip pvm3.4.3.tgz
	tar -xvf pvm3.4.3.tar
	cd pvm3
	setenv PVM_ROOT `pwd`
	make

Note carefully the value of PVM_ROOT--it will be needed when configuring the
mls software.	
	
FFTW
It is possible that workable fftw libraries already exist on your platform. For
example, JPL's EOS-MLS computers all have it in /usr/local/lib. You can check
this via
	me:51%ls /usr/local/lib/*fftw*
	/usr/local/lib/libfftw.a     /usr/local/lib/librfftw.a
	/usr/local/lib/libfftw.la*   /usr/local/lib/librfftw.la*

and the result, displayed beneath the ls command, indicates a positive match. In
such a case, note that the FFTW_ROOT should take the value of "/usr/local/lib".

Otherwise, the distribution to build the libraries and ancillary files making up
the FFTW libraries can be found at 
	http://www.fftw.org/download.html
Follow the instructions found in INSTALL and note carefully where it places
libfftw.a and librfftw.a. If you lack root privileges, remember to use
	configure --prefix=installation_directory_name
before
	make
	make install

An extra wrinkle, especially if you are installing onto a linux platform, is
that you may have to edit the configure.in file. Without this change, the
resulting library will contain object files with the wrong number of
underscores appended. In particular, look for the line with
	 AC_CHECK_PROGS(F77, f77 xlf xlf77 cf77 fl32 g77 fort77 f90 xlf90)
and replace it with
		AC_CHECK_PROGS(F77, f95 f77 xlf xlf77 cf77 fl32 g77 fort77 f90 xlf90)

Thanks to Robert Thurstans (JPL) for pointing this out.

BLAS
It is possible that highly-optimized blas libraries exist on your platform or
are made available through your f95 compiler or hardware vendor. If so, you
should note their paths and names. For example, Intel supplies: libmkl32_p3.a,
libmkl32_p4.a and libmkl64_itp.a. Or your compiler vendor or OS vendor may have
put a copy in an easy-to-access place: e.g.

me/mlspgs:186%ls /usr/lib/*blas*
/usr/lib/libblas.a    /usr/lib/libblas.so.3@@    /usr/lib/libblas.so.3.0.3*
/usr/lib/libblas.so@@  /usr/lib/libblas.so.3.0@@

In either case, note
(1) Whether you have such a library; and
(2) If so, its path and name

You have to choose one of the three options:
(a) Use the externally-supplied library of BLAS routines
(b) Use f95 intrinsics to satisfy BLAS routines
(c) Let the mls software build its own BLAS routines

Note that (b) and (c) will always be available, and (c) is the built-in default

LAPACK
Highly-optimized LAPACK libraries may also exist on your platform. Again,
note their paths and names. 

If you are ambitious, you might check the site named ATLAS for "Automatically
Tuned Linear Algebra Software"
   http://www.netlib.org/atlas/index.html
so that you can download or indeed build your own. In an albeit artificial
benchmark its use resulted in an order-of-magnitude speedup on a dual-processor
pentium III doing matrix operations.

You have to choose one of the two options:
(a) Use the externally-supplied library of LAPACK routines
(b) Use f95 intrinsics to satisfy LAPACK routines

Note that (b) will always be available, and is the built-in default
