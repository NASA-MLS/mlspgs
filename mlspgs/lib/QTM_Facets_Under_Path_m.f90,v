module QTM_Facets_Under_Path_m
!=============================================================================

  ! Find the facets of a QTM that are under a path.

  ! This is useful to avoid computations above the surface, such as
  ! interpolating temperature to the entire Zeta Gauss-Legendre grid, and
  ! hydrostatic equilibrium, at vertices of other facets, that are not under
  ! the path, and for which therefore the coefficients to interpolate from
  ! their vertices to the path will be zero.
