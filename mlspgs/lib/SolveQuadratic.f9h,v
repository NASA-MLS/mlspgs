! subroutine SolveQuadratic( a, b, c, r1, r2, imPart )
    ! Solve

    ! a x^2 + b x + c = 0

    ! for x = r1 + i imPart, and x = r2 - i imPart
    ! where i^2 = -1

    ! Of course because a, b, and c are all purely real
    ! if imPart /= 0, r1 = r2

    ! We bother with this to avoid truncation that would result
    ! from taking a difference between like-signed quantities
    ! b and + or - sqrt(disc)

    ! Special cases (which you may prefer to intercept yourself)
    ! If a = 0, we return the same root in both r1 and r2
    ! If a = b = 0, we divide c by zero
