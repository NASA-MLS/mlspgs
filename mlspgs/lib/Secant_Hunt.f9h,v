! subroutine Secant_Hunt_* ( Array, Target, Loc, Probes )

    ! Look for Target in Array(1:N) using a secant method, which has log log N
    ! complexity.  If Target < Array(1), Loc = 0.  If Target >= Array(N), Loc =
    ! N.  Else Loc = I such that Array(i) <= Loc <= Array(i+1) with equality in
    ! the upper case only if Array(i) == Array(i+1).  If Array(i) == Array(i+1)
    ! for several values of I, any of those values of I could be reported.

    ! Assumes Array(:) is ordered.  Will fail silently and badly otherwise.
