; This section of the l2cf describes the criteria for dividing the Level 1B
; data into chunks for the processing.
;
BEGIN ChunkDivide
   ;;
   ;; The items in this section may occur in any order.
   ;;
   ;; Desirable length of a chunk, specified as a given fraction of an orbit
   ;;
   chunk,IdealLength=0.25 orbits
   ;;
   ;; How many MAFs of overlap are desirable
   ;;
   chunk,Overlap =5 MAFs
   ;;
   ;; Home Geodetic Angle (phi) to try to start at least one chunk at
   ;;
   chunk,HomeGeodAngle=0.0 degrees
   ;;
   ;; Home Module upon whose scans the chunk division will be based (default =
   ;; GHz)
   ;;
   chunk,HomeModule= "GHz"
   ;;
   ;; Minimum criteria for a valid scan
   ;;
   chunk,ScanLowerLimit= -10.0 .. 25.0 km
   chunk,ScanUpperLimit= 40.0 .. 100.0 km
   ;;
   chunk,CriticalScanningModules= "Both"
   ;;
   ;; Alternatives to 'both' are 'THz', 'GHz', 'either', or 'none'
   ;;
   ;; Bands that must be on for data to be considered useful
   ;;
   chunk,CriticalBands="R1A.B1F/R1B.B21F, R5H:B17F/R5V:B20F"
   ;;
   ;; How long a data gap (i.e., one of the above criteria not being met) is
   ;; allowed before a chunk division is forced -- this may be specified in
   ;; minutes, seconds, orbits, degress (of phi), or MAFs.
   ;;
   chunk,MaxGap= 3.0 minutes
   ;;
END ChunkDivide
