I've changed the syntax of the ``range'' operator from ``..'' to ``:''.
This simplified the lexical analysis of the input substantially.

I've not implemented the possibility to specify a semi-infinite range by
``a:'' or ``:b'' because it is ambiguous:  We allow ``name = expr expr
....'' If the first ``expr'' is ``a:'' and the second is ``b'', this
could equally well be interpreted as just one expr, ``a : b''.

The interpretation of a specification is not consistent.  In some
sections, e.g. {\tt Construct}, a specification is introduced by an
initial name known to the processor e.g. vGrid,, followed by a comma, and
the identifier of the specification is provided by a phrase of the form
{\tt name =} \emph{identifier}.  In other sections, e.g. {\tt
ReadApriori} the initial name (preceeding the comma) is an identifier for
the specification, chosen by the user, and the name of the specification
is implied by the section name.

I would like to make the syntax consistent.  This would ease parsing and
interpretation.  I propose that in a specification, a name followed by a
comma should always introduces the specification, and the name of the
specification should be known to the processor, e.g. ``quantity''.  In
order to give an identifier of the user's choosing to the specification,
I suggest beginning the specification with a name followed by a colon. 
Thus the {\tt ReadApriori} and {\tt MergeApriori} sections would have
specifications of the form

{\tt aprioriGPH: apriori, source=GPH, length=200km, ...} and\\
{\tt merge, apriori=aprioriGPH, source=NCEP, species=temperature, ...}

while the {\tt Construct} section would have specifications of the form

{\tt VGridHiRes: VGrid, coordinate=pressure, values=log 1000 mb 60 12\\
temp: quantity, VGrid=VGridHiRes, ...}

Is the set of ``$<$name$>$='' notations for a given specification known
and fixed, or chosen by the user?  For example, in the {\tt
ProfileLayout} specification, I see {\tt type=fractional, fraction=0.5}. 
Are the names {\tt type} and {\tt fractional} known to the program?  If
so, is there an exhaustive list for each specification?

Are the identifiers that appear after the ``='' in ``$<$name$>$=''
notations fixed, or chosen by the user?  For example, in the previous
paragraph, is the name ``{\tt fractional}'' known to the processor?  If
so, is there an exhaustive list for each notation in each specification?
