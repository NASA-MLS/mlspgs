The forward model integrates the radiative-transfer equation along several
lines of sight at several frequencies, and calculates derivatives of the
computed radiance with respect to state vector elements.  See \h{wvs-090}
and \h{wvs-093}.

The \emph{state vector} is a one-dimensional concatenation of all species
under consideration by the forward model.  Each element's value
corresponds to a four-tuple $[f, \zeta, \phi, S]$, where $f$ is frequency,
\Z\ is the negative base-10 logarithm of pressure, $\phi$ is orbit geodetic
angle, and $S$ is a species index.  Most species' mixing ratios do not
depend upon frequency.  The number of \Z\ indices could be different for
each species.  The number of $\phi$ indices is assumed to be the same for
all species.

The {\tt Grids_f} structure defined in {\tt load_sps_data_m} is a
representation of the state vector, including the frequencies and
geolocations for each element, taken from \emph{vector quantities} of the
{\tt Input} and {\tt Extra} \emph{vectors} provided to the forward model. 
For details of the distinction between \emph{vector quantities} and
\emph{vectors}, consult {\tt VectorsModule}.

There are several arrays of indices and flags in the forward model that
indicate where calculations are needed.

The \emph{coarse path} is the set of points where the line of sight
pierces surfaces of constant pressure.  The tangent point is represented
twice so that we can multiply by Earth reflectivity if the ray is
reflected from the Earth's surface, or 1.0 if it's not.

The set of constant pressure surfaces that determines the coarse path is
the union of the sets of pressure coordinates for all state vector
elements.

The \emph{fine path} is the coarse path with Gauss-Legendre quadrature
abscissae inserted between every pair of coarse path points.  There is
space for these abscissae between the two coarse path points that
represent the tangent point, but they're never used.  We might someday
choose to use Gauss-Lobatto quadrature.  ``GL'' is used below for either
Gauss-Legendre quadrature or Gauss-Lobatto quadrature.

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt NG}] is the number of GL abscissae inserted between coarse path
  points.

\item[{\tt NGP1}] is {\tt NG + 1}

\item[{\tt Eta_ZP}] is an rank-2 array of interpolating coefficients from
  the \Z\ and $\phi$ coordinates of the state vector onto the fine path,
  for all species including those that depend upon frequency.  Its extents
  are the number of fine path points on the current line of sight, and the
  total number of state-vector elements, not counting frequency
  dependence.

\item[{\tt Do_Calc_ZP}] is a rank-2 array of logical values indicating
  where {\tt Eta_ZP} is not zero.  Its shape is the same as {\tt Eta_ZP}.

  [This has been removed as of 2018 May 08.  Instead, one column of it is
  computed from {\tt Eta_ZP} as needed when computing derivatives.]

\item[{\tt Eta_FZP}] is a rank-2 array of interpolating coefficients from
  the $f$, \Z\ and $\phi$ coordinates of the state vector onto the fine
  path, also for all species.  Columns for species that do not depend upon
  frequency are simply copies of corresponding columns of {\tt Eta_ZP}. 
  For those quantities that depend upon frequency, a number of columns
  equal to the number of frequencies in {\tt Grids_f} are copied from {\tt
  Eta_ZP}, and then each of those columns is multiplied by the
  interpolating coefficient from the frequency grid for the species to the
  pointing frequency grid for the line of sight.  {\tt Eta_ZP} and {\tt
  Eta_FZP} are separate because {\tt Eta_ZP} depends only upon the line of
  sight, and is therefore computed outside the frequency loop.  The
  frequency dependence of {\tt Eta_FZP} is computed within the frequency
  loop.  Its extents are the number of fine path points on the current
  line of sight, and the total number of state-vector elements, including
  frequency dependence.

\item[{\tt Do_Calc_FZP}] is a rank-2 array of logical values indicating
  where {\tt Eta_FZP} is not zero.  Its shape is the same as {\tt
  Eta_FZP}.

  [This has been removed as of 2018 May 08.  Instead, one column of it is
  computed from {\tt Eta_FZP} as needed when computing derivatives.]

\item[{\tt Do_GL}] is a rank-1 logical array indexed by the coarse path
  index that indicates it is necessary to use GL for sufficient accuracy. 
  Otherwise, trapezoidal quadrature is used.

\item[{\tt F_Inds}] is a rank-1 array of integers that gives the fine path
  indices of all and only the GL abscissae.  This includes indices for GL
  abscissae that are not used because trapezoidal quadrature is good
  enough; it does not include the coarse path points.

\item[{\tt GL_Inds}] is a rank-1 array of integers, a subset of {\tt
  F_Inds}, that gives the fine path indices only of GL abscissae on panels
  of the coarse path for which GL is necessary.  This does not include the
  coarse path points, or fine path points on panels where GL is not
  necessary.

\end{description}

Within {\tt rad_tran_m} the {\tt Get_Do_Calc_Indexed} subroutine uses {\tt
GL_Inds} (which it confusingly calls {\tt F_Inds}) to calculate:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt Do_Calc}] is a rank-1 logical array indexed by the coarse path
  index that indicates that {\tt Do_Calc_FZP} is true for at least one GL
  point in the panel.  {\tt Do_Calc} might be true even if neither of the
  elements at coarse-path positions in {\tt Do_Calc_FZP} are true.

\item[{\tt Inds}] are a rank-1 array of coarse path indices where {\tt
Do_Calc} is true.

\item[{\tt N_Inds}] is the number of true elements in {\tt Do_Calc}, and
  the number of meaningful elements in {\tt Inds}.

\end{description}

Within {\tt Get_Do_Calc_Indexed} the {\tt Do_Calc_All} dummy argument is
one column of {\tt Do_Calc_FZP}.

Within {\tt rad_tran_m} the {\tt Get_All_d_delta_df} subroutine uses
{\tt get_inds} to compute two more sets of indices

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt More_Inds}] are indices on the coarse path where GL gets
  applied.

\item[{\tt All_Inds}] are the first of the {\tt NG} indices in {\tt
  GL_Inds} for which GL is used.  The remaining {\tt NG - 1} are
  consecutive, so we don't need them.
