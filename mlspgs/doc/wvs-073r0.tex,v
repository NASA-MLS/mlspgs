The slides for my presentation of variable projection are in {\tt
$\sim$vsnyder/mls/doc/wvs-072.pdf}.  I think the approach described therein,
and the approach Bill discussed, are very similar.  See also {\tt
http://www-sccm.stanford.edu/pub/sccm/sccm-02-07.ps.gz} (also in
{\tt $\sim$vsnyder/mls/doc}).

In addition to these and the topics on Nathaniel's slides, we should not forget
that we also discussed

\begin{itemize}
\item Tomographic methods to decouple ray tracing, allowing to solve for
temperature and mixing ratio separately in each parcel.  There is a chance that
these are very closely related to the variable-projection and extinction-based
methods, with the additional possibility that decoupling can be done with an
FFT-based approach, which would have $O(n \log n)$ complexity instead of
$O(n^3)$ complexity.

\item New computing platforms, especially IBM's Cell-BE (Broadband Engine)
architecture.  IBM has Fortran and C compilers, and system-development kits,
for this processor.  IBM plans to produce blade-based clusters using this
processor.  The Sony Playstation 3 is built using this processor.  Mercury
Computer Systems, Inc.~(http://mc.com/microsites/cell/) offers systems
(including workstations, and 1U and blade-based clusters), PCI boards, and
software.  It may be worthwhile to investigate using graphics chips for some
steps as well.

\item VLSI neural nets, especially analog VLSI (for speed).

\end{itemize}
