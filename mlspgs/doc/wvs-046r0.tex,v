We have tabulated $H$ on the composite $\zeta$ basis and the temperature $\phi$
basis in the {\tt h\_ref} array in {\tt metrics}.  We also have
$\diff{H}{\zeta}$ on the same grid in the {\tt dhidzij} array.

Assume that $\phi_t=0$ corresponds to a column of {\tt h\_ref}, choose $\phi_1$
an adjacent $\phi$ from the temperature basis that corresponds to an adjacent
column of {\tt h\_ref}, and choose a row of {\tt h\_ref} that corresponds to
$H_t$.  Call the tangent row and column indices of {\tt h\_ref} $i$ and $j$, so
{\tt h\_ref(i,j)}=$H_t$, assume the adjacent column is $j+1$, and refer to {\tt
h\_ref(i,j+1)} as $H_1$.

A ray parallel to the tangent ray that intersects the radius $\phi_1$ at $H$
will intersect the radius $\phi=0$ at $H \cos \phi_1$.

Geometrically along the tangent ray, we have $H(\phi) = H_t \sec \phi$ and
$\diff{H}{\phi} = H_t \sec \phi \tan\phi$ where $0 \leq \phi \leq
\phi_1$, and $\left.\diff{H}{\phi} \right|_{\phi=\phi_1} = H_t \sec \phi_1
\tan\phi_1$.  Along the ray parallel to the tangent ray, we have $H(\phi) = H_t
\cos \phi_1 \sec \phi$, $\diff{H}{\phi} = H_t \cos \phi_1 \sec \phi \tan
\phi$ and $\left.\diff{H}{\phi} \right|_{\phi=\phi_1} = H_t \cos \phi_1 \sec
\phi_1 \tan\phi_1 = H_t \tan \phi_1$.

We could either find $\phi$ for the minimum $\zeta$ along a constant-$H_t$
surface, or find $\phi$ for the minimum $H$ along a constant-$\zeta$ surface
that includes $\zeta(H_t,\phi_t)$.  I think these problems are equivalent.

Another possibility is to assume that our ``constant-$\zeta$'' rows of {\tt
h\_ref} actually represent a single $\zeta$ value only at the $\phi$ values
that represent the columns, and that for intermediate values of $\phi$, $\zeta$
might not be a constant.

We have $\diff{H}{\zeta}$ from {\tt dhidzij}, and $\diff{H}{\phi}$ from
geometry.  From these two we can calculate $\diff{\zeta}{\phi} =
\diff{H}{\phi}\,\diff{\zeta}{H}$.  From geometry we have
$\left.\diff{\zeta}{\phi}\right|_{\phi=0}=0$.  Let
$\left.\diff{\zeta}{\phi}\right|_{\phi=\phi_1} = 
\left.\diff{H}{\phi} \diff{\zeta}{H}\right|_{\phi=\phi_1} =
\left.H_t \tan\phi_1 \diff{\zeta}{H}\right|_{\phi=\phi_1} = w$.
From the two derivatives and $\zeta(\phi=0)=\zeta(\phi=\phi_1)=\zeta_0$, we can
use Hermite interpolation to construct a polynomial $\zeta(x) \approx P(x) = a
x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d$, where $x = \frac{\phi}{\phi_1}$. When we substitute the
given values in $P(x)$ and $P^\prime(x)$, we find $a=w$, $b=-w$, $c=0$ and
$d=\zeta_0$.  Substituting these coefficients, setting $P^\prime(x)=0$, and
solving for $x$, we find, interestingly, $x_1=0$ and $x_2=\frac23$.  That is,
the extremum for $P(x)$ always occurs at $\phi=0$ or $\phi=\frac23 \phi_1$.  If
$w>0$ the interior extremum is a maximum; if $w<0$ it is a minimum.  If $w=0$
then $\zeta=\zeta_0$ throughout the interval, at least to the extent $P(x)$ can
model $\zeta$, and there is no unique extremum within the interval.

If we want to solve for the minimum $H$ along the constant-$\zeta$ surface, we
can use the geometric derivatives $\left.\diff{H}{\phi}\right|_{\phi=0}=0$ and
$\left.\diff{H}{\phi}\right|_{\phi=\phi_1}=H_t \tan \phi_1 = w$, from which we
conclude that $a=2(H_t-H_1)+w$, $b=-(3(H_t-H_1+w)$, $c=0$, $d=H_t$, and the
extrema for $H$ occur for $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\frac23
\frac{3(H_t-H_1)+w}{2(H_t-H_1)+w} \phi_1$.  This reduces to the previous result
$\left(\phi=\frac23 \phi_1\right)$ when $H_t=H_1$.  We know this is a minimum
because $H_t \tan(\phi) > 0$ for $\phi>0$.  $\phi=\phi_1$ when $H_1=H_t$ and
$w=0$.  For $w=6400 \tan(1^\circ)$, $\phi<0$ for $H_1 > \approx H_t+37$.

Even though $\diff{P(x)}{x}$ appears to be quadratic, a square root does not
appear in the solutions because $c=0$, which occurs because
$\left.\diff{\zeta}{\phi}\right|_{\phi=0}=0$ and
$\left.\diff{H}{\phi}\right|_{\phi=0}=0$.

Either way, this leads to a simpler algorithm than outlined in wvs-045.  The
reason that solving for minimum $\zeta$ using Hermite interpolation in the
present version of {\tt metrics} isn't working is that I'm working along the
line of sight instead of surfaces of constant $H$ or $\zeta$. As you expected,
$\zeta$ is monotone increasing away from the tangent point along the line of
sight.
