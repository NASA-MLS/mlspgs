In addition to the ideas mentioned in wvs-051, a few more possibilities for
speeding up MLS Level 2 retrievals have occurred to me.

\begin{enumerate}

\item wvs-051 suggested to solve for feature parameters.  A similar idea
is to solve for the Planck function instead of temperature.  This
wouldn't reduce the number of things to solve for, but it would make
derivatives simpler, and might make the problem sufficiently more linear
as to require fewer iterations.  Of course, temperature is the ultimately
interesting quantity, and I'm not sure exactly which frequency ought to
be used to get from the Planck function to the temperature, especially if
a retrieval uses several signals from several bands.

\item It might be possible to develop a strategy to keep the Jacobian
constant every now and then, instead of re-evaluating it at every
iteration.  This might increase the number of iterations, but they would
be substantially cheaper ones.

\item Solving at only the highest elevations in the atmosphere is cheaper
than solving at all of them.  If we solve for the highest levels of the
atmosphere before solving at lower levels, and use those results instead
during the lower-level retrievals, the full solution might require
sufficiently fewer iterations to repay the cost of the high-altitude
solutions.  In the all-altitudes retrieval, the prior high-altitude
solutions would be ``locked in,'' so the lower-altitude retrievals would
have lower cost.  Generalizing, perhaps an ``onion peeling'' strategy
might be profitable.

\item If when processing a chunk starts an adjacent chunk has already
finished, using the solution in the overlap region might be sufficiently
better than apriori that the number of iterations would be reduced.  This
might be especially beneficial for reprocessing: Launch solvers for even
numbered chunks; then when they're done launch solvers for odd-numbered
ones.

\end{enumerate}

The first two would require software development.  The last two could
be done in the l2cf alone.

With some modifications to the forward model, the ``onion peeling''
strategy might allow to reduce forward model run time, by keeping
intermediate results from the high altitudes as well as just the state
vector solutions -- assuming we have room to keep them.
