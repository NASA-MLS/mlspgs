@\section{Introduction and background}
\label{sec:Introduction}

This document describes the external interface for, and other details
of, the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) `IDL Callable Forward Model' 
(ICFM hereafter).  More information on Aura MLS can be found in
\citet{WatersEtal06}. ICFM is an IDL programming interface to the 
'Callable Forward Model' (CFM hereafter), of which more information
can be found in \citet{NguyenEtal10}. ICFM allows users to call CFM
from IDL by using PVM to communicate between IDL and Fortran processes.

Section~\ref{sec:Review} reviews the overall structure of the CFM,
including an outline of relevant underlying aspects of the MLS
instrument, operations and data processing algorithms. This information
can also be found in \citet{NguyenEtal10}.
Section~\ref{sec:Reference} serves as a reference for the various data
types and procedures that constitute the ICFM software.
Appendix~\ref{app:Example} gives examples of code that invokes the
foward model that can serve as a starting point for assimilation studies etc.
Finally, Appendix~\ref{app:Lists} provides tables and
lists of relevant terms (units etc.).
