Dave asked me to investigate whether using hardware-assist devices based upon
FPGA or DSP chips might provide a substantial reduction in MLSL2 run time. This
got me started investigating where MLSL2 spends its time.

Paul gave me an {\tt l2cf} named {\tt nopcf\_v02-21-c01\_2005d028.l2cf}, which
is representative of our production processing configuration.  All of the
performance improvements were tuned to this l2cf.

Actions and performance improvements are summarized in the following table.

\begin{tabular}{p{5in}|r}

\end{tabular}

We couldn't use ATLAS BLAS dot product with the Intel compiler because {\tt
gcc} uses the floating-point stack pointer differently from how the Intel
compiler expects it to, resulting in NaNs.

We have had to stop using the {\tt -O3 -xW -no-prec-div} options with the Intel
compiler because at least one of them (maybe a conspiracy of them) results in
non-repeatable results.

These two disappointments have increased run times significantly from the best
we achieved, but the overall improvement is still substantial.
