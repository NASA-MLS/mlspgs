The ability to specify or solve for spectral parameter offsets from the
catalog has been added to MLSL2.  The parameters that can be offset are
line center, line width, and line width temperature dependence.

To specify that the forward model is to include the offsets in its
calculation for a particular molecule, it is necessary so to specify in
the {\tt ForwardModel} specification in the L2CF.  This is done by using
three fields, named {\tt LineCenter}, {\tt LineWidth}, and {\tt
LineWidth\_TDep}.  The value for each of these fields is a list of
molecules, which must be in the {\tt molecules} list, and not PFA.  These
specify the molecules for which the parameters are to be offset from
their catalog values.

It is necessary to have state vector quantities defined for each spectral
parameter and molecule for which the offsets are to be used.  This is done
with a {\tt Quantity} specification, e.g.

{\tt\begin{verbatim}
  lineCenter_O2_V1: Quantity, type=lineCenter, molecule=O2_V1, $
    hGrid=hGridStandard, vGrid=vGridStandard
\end{verbatim}}

Once the quantity is established, it is necessary to mention it in the
definition(s) of vector(s).  It must appear in the vector specified in
the {\tt FwdModelIn} field of a {\tt SIDS} or the {\tt state} field of a
{\tt Retrieve} specification, and any necessary vectors isomorphic to
those.

The quantities must be filled with initial values.  Presumably for a
retrieval, these will be filled with zeros, e.g.

{\tt\begin{verbatim}
  Fill, quantity=state.LineCenter_O2_V1, method=explicit, $
    explicitValues=0Ghz, /spread
\end{verbatim}}

although for a SIDS run they might be filled with other values for
experimental purposes.

For line center and line width, the units of the fill value must be
frequency.  For line width temperature dependence, the units must be
dimensionless.

Derivatives of radiance with respect to these quantities is caused by the
presence of a Jacobian matrix.  This is of course required in a {\tt 
Retrieve} specification using the full forward model.  It can be
specified in a {\tt sids} specification for an L2PC run.

It is not at present possible to specify these quantities in the
``Forward Model Extra'' vector, which would cause them to be offset from
the catalog, but a retrieval would not solve for them.  This would be a
simple modification if it becomes necessary or desirable to do so.
