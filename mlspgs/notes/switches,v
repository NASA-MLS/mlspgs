========================= end mlsl2 =========================

Programmers' notes:
The general pattern is to use upper-case letters for single-letter ones,
and lower-case letters for strings. Switches are case-sensitive.

The -S option sets the "switches" array in toggles_core.f90.
`
You can separate them either by preceding each with its own "-S" prefix or
else by commas in a single string. Thus to turn on both 'abc' and 'def',
either use -Sabc -Sdef or -S"abc,def". Among other good things, this
prevents accidentally turning on an unwanted 'cde' switch.

An alternate way to turn on switches is via the --setf opts-file mechanism
Include a line in your opts-file like this
 switches=abc,def
to turn on the 2 switches 'abc' and 'def'.

The MLSStringLists module contains a function SwitchDetail; assuming it
was called as SwitchDetail(switches, 'foo') it returns 
-1  means foo was not among switches
0   means foo or foo0 was one of the comma-separated switches
1   means foo1
2   means foo2
    .   .   .
Note that use of SwitchDetail requires separating the switches. It also
requires that you match the switch name precisely; e.g. if the switch is
"ab" but you forget, and so try to set "abc", you won't set "ab" after
all. The advantage is that by using SwitchDetail each switch is now
unique: you can have "foo", "bar", and "foobar" as three distinct
switches, confident that setting "foobar" won't inadvertently set the
other two.

Here's a trick for finding all the switches referred to by switchdetail in
our code so far:
cd ~/mlspgs
grep -i switchdetail */*.[fF]9* | grep -i 'switches' | sed 's/.*switches,//' \
 | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/)//' | sort | uniq

The same command, but replacing "switchdetail" with "index" will show all the 
switches referred to by the "index(switches, .." method. 

Two alternate commands
grep -i beverbose */*.[fF]9* | grep -v -i highoutput | sed 's/.*BeVerbose//' \
 | sed 's/(/( /' | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/,//' | sort | uniq
can be used to handle the instances of BeVerbose.

grep -i letsdebug */*.[fF]9* | grep -v -i highoutput | sed 's/.*BeVerbose//' \
 | sed 's/(/( /' | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/,//' | sort | uniq
can be used to handle the instances of LetsDebug.

The resulting lists have grown too large to keep updating this list. We need
a better tool to organize it.

(Add any more that are relevant to mlsl2,
or separate sections for mlsl1 or mlsl3)

(The equal signs in the section dividers above are to help
sed dynamically update mlsl2 to show changes in the switch
usage automatically. Thus you only need to edit this file,
not MLSL2.f90. Add your changes inside the space book-ended
by the equal-signs -- stuff outside that space, like these
comments, will be ignored when responding to mlsl2 -S"?")

                T e s t   1
In places, it's still tested by the older construct 
a151 2
which allowed you to put longer strings on the command line (so long as
the rest of it didn't contain something you DIDN'T want to test for!).
d153 7
a159 17
Let us clarify the requirement for adding new switches according to this
restriction:
if an existing switch is 'abc' don't add a new switch that contains 'abc' as a
substring, e.g. 'gabcs'. Why? Because turning on your switch will automatically
turn on the existing 'abc' switch, too.

We recommend separating switches rather than catenating them. You can separate
them either by preceding each with its own "-S" prefix or else by commas in a
single string. Thus to turn on both 'abc' and 'def', either use -Sabc -Sdef or
-S"abc,def". Among other good things, this prevents accidentally turning on an
unwanted 'cde' switch.

                T e s t   2
As an alternative to the "if ( index(switches,'foo') /= 0 ) then ..." test shown
above, the MLSStringLists module contains a function SwitchDetail which as a
substitute has its advantages; assuming it was called as
SwitchDetail(switches, 'foo') it returns 
d165 7
a171 11
Note that use of SwitchDetail requires separating the switches. It also requires
that you match the switch name precisely; e.g. if the switch is "ab" but you
forget, and so try to set "abc", you won't set "ab" after all. The advantage is
that by using SwitchDetail each switch is now unique: you can have "foo", "bar",
and "foobar" as three distinct switches, confident that setting "foobar" won't
inadvertently set the other two.

I have been substituting SwitchDetail for the "if ( index .." test in the
modules that have come under my gaze from time to time, and this process will
continue until they take my keyboard away. When I'm done, we will be able to
delete the T e s t   1 section above.

It's tested by "if ( index(switches,'foo') /= 0 ) then ..." so
you can put longer strings on the command line (so long as the rest
of it doesn't contain something you DON'T want to test for!).
 E.g. -Ssca could mean -Sscalars
but beware: literally setting -Sscalars may also turn on an unwanted switch,
"lars", causing mlsl2 to begin outputting all text in "Swedish Chef" mode
BORK! BORK! BORK!
(The above joke has fallen flat--
it is deprecated and may be removed in a future revision)

Let us clarify the requirement for adding new switches above:
if an existing switch is 'abc' don't add a new switch that contains
'abc' as a substring. Why? Because turning on your switch will
automatically turn on the existing 'abc' switch, too.

As of Oct 9 2003, we recommend separating switches with a comma rather
than catenating them. Thus to turn on both 'abc' and 'def', either use
-Sabc -Sdef or -S"abc,def". Among other good things, this prevents
accidentally turning on an unwanted 'cde' switch.
