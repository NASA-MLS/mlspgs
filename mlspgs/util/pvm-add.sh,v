# --------------- pvm-add help
# Script to add nodes to pvm and optionally set them to useable by
# an already-running l2q
# Usage:
# pvm-add.sh [opt] node1 [node2] .. [noden]
#
#    O p t i o n s
# -h[elp]       print brief help message; exit
# -l2q          tell l2q to resurrect nodes, too
#
# Note:
# (1) pvm (and l2q) must be in your PATH and runnable
# (2) passwordless ssh must be enabled
# (3) nodes must be visible and reachable by ssh
# 
# Result:
# pvm will be started on nodes
# Optionally, already-running l2q will be able to grant nodes to master tasks
