@; Grammar for grammar

; Semicolon not within a string enclosed in quotes or apostrophes
; introduces a comment, which continues to the end of the line.

; Define the terminal symbols using names from your Symbol_Types module.
; The syntax is "grammar term = symbol name".  "grammar term" can be
; either a name, or a string enclosed in quotes or apostrophes.

'='    = t_equal
'->'   = t_produces
'=>'   = t_generates
'?'    = t_question
EOS    = t_eos
EOG    = t_end_of_input ; EOG is generated; the parser assumes it is defined
name   = t_identifier
number = t_number
string = t_string

; Now the productions.  The syntax for one production is
; LHS ( -> RHS ( => ACT '?' ? ) ? EOS )+
; where LHS is a nonterminal symbol,
;       RHS is a sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols,
;       ACT is the name of a tree node from your Tree_Types module, or a
;           number,
;       EOS means "end of statement", which is end of line or the
;           beginning of a comment, unless the production is continued by
;           a "$"
;       '?' means "do the action only if the RHS generated more than one
;           tree node,
;       ? means "can appear zero or one times, and
;       + means "can appear more than one time.

; A comment beginning with semicolon continues to the end of the line.
; If it appears and "$" does not appear before it, it is an end of statement.
