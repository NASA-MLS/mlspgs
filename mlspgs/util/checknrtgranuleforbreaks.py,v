# this routine depends on teh IDL runtime saveset
# checknrtchunkforbreaks.sav. To create this runtime, do the following.
#
# Create a directory where you want to build the runtime saveset.
# copy over te file go to
# ~whdaffer/devel/mls/nrt/idl/make-checkchunkforbreaks-rt-saveset.pro
# to that directory.
#
# Make sure you have ~whdaffer/devel in your IDL path, with the '+'
# in front, so that IDL knows to traverse the tree while running the
# software to create the runtime.
#
# CD into that directory and do the following (the '%' is the sign for
# the shell prompt, so I want you to do this at the shell prompt.
#
# % idl make-checkchunkforbreaks-rt-saveset.pro
# 
# When that finishes, the runtime will be in the directory 
#
# Move that file to whatever you need to run the routine. Be aware
# that the working directory of an IDL runtime is the directory in
# which the runtime resides, *NOT* the working directory of the
# process that calls the runtime. If you need to run in a directory
# different from the one where the runtime lives, you can either copy
# it over to your working directory or set a symbolic link. 
#
# This routine makes the assumption that the runtime is in the CWD
# wheter this script is invoked.

This script is a simple wrapper for the idl routine
checknrtchunkforbreaks.pro. This routine takes the L2GP file for one
NRT chunk and checks it for `breaks'. If an error occurs, the IDL
exits with a status of -1, if the file has no breaks, IDL exits with a
status of 0 and if the file has 1 or more breaks, the status is 1

# Revision 1.8  2022/09/15 00:11:17  whdaffer
# Print STDOUT/STDERR regardless of return status from process running
# the IDL runtime. Need more info, not less. Deal with bytecode variables.
#
# Revision 1.7  2021/05/17 18:08:37  whdaffer
# Added from __future__ import print_function
#
# Revision 1.6  2021/05/05 14:28:16  whdaffer
# python 3 upgrade
#
# Revision 1.5  2017/06/26 22:31:30  whdaffer
# Took out dependency on verbose when the return status from the IDL is
# other than [-1, 0, 2]
#
# Revision 1.4  2017/06/26 21:12:52  whdaffer
# Added some more reportage to the `some other error occurred' message
#
# Revision 1.3  2017/05/18 23:06:29  whdaffer
# Added another branch to the test of return code from subprocess to
# handle any other error
#
# Revision 1.2  2017/02/23 19:34:24  whdaffer
# Changed idl -rt command line
#
# Revision 1.1  2017/02/23 19:33:49  whdaffer
# Renamed checknrtchunkforbreaks.py to checknrtgranuleforbreaks.py
