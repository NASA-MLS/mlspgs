\section{Examples}
\label{app:Example}

\subsection{Opening and closing files}
This code sample shows how files are opened and closed by the MLSCFM
software (which presents the same interface to calling code regardless
of whether the EOS Science Data Processing toolkit is used or not).

\lstinputlisting{open-file.f9h}

\subsection{Invoking a forward model}

The following code gives an example of a simple program that invokes the
MLS callable forward model.

\lstinputlisting{mockup.f90}

\tbd{All these examples will probably be fleshed out with more calls and
  data types as this work evolves.}
