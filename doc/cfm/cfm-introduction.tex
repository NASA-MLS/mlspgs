\section{Introduction and background}

This document describes the external interface for the Aura Microwave
Limb Sounder (MLS) `Callable Forward Model' (CFM hereafter).  More
information on Aura MLS can be found in \citet{WatersEtal06}.  The task
of the MLS forward model(s) is to compute MLS radiances corresponding to
supplied profiles of atmospheric temperature and composition (along with
auxiliary quantities, spectroscopy, and calibration information).  More
information on the MLS forward models can be found in \citet{ReadEtal06}
for the `full forward model' and \citet{SchwartzEtal06} for the
`polarized model' used for Zeeman-split oxygen lines in the mesosphere.
\citet{WuEtal06} describe the cloud scattering forward model (used
mainly for pre-launch simulations).

The CFM is an extraction of the forward models from the MLS Level~2
processing software (MLSL2 hereafter).  Extracting the forward models
into stand-alone Fortran~90 modules enables their use in a variety of
applications, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data assimilation systems evaluating and/or assimilating MLS
  radiances.
\item Off-line calculations to characterize MLS observations and to
  evaluate systematic errors in MLS-like observing systems.
\item OSSE frameworks to further evaluate MLS-like observing systems and
  ascertain their ability to answer specific atmospheric science questions.
\end{itemize}

In its current form, this document is mainly aimed at the first of these
applications.
