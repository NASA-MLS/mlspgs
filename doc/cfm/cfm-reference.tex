\subsection{Procedures and functions}

\mycomment{Each procedure will be introduced and described in a very
  general way. The example near the end of this document should show
  sufficient detail to make how and when to use each perfectly clear.

  In presenting the list of procedures, one ordering we might have
  followed would have gone from first called to last called.  Another
  ordering would have been a descending hierarchy.

  Steering a middle course, we have tried to do both.}
