\cfCommand{Fill}{Fill}

\begin{cfFragment}
Fill, quantity=<vector>.<quantity>, method=<fill method>, <parameters>
\end{cfFragment}

Fill is one of the most complex commands in the level~2 configuration
file.  It is used to fill the values of one quantity within a vector.
The data placed in the quantity can come from a variety of sources.
These are distinguished by the `fill method'.

Some but not all of the fill methods obey the `fill' mask flag.  Those
that do, typically also take the \cf+dontMask+ option, which indicates
that the fill mask flag should be ignored.

The rest of this section breaks down the various fill methods in detail.

% Each fill method is described in alphabetical order.  If you add more
% methods please do so in a separate file as done below, and in the
% right place.

\newcommand{\fillMaskComment}{This command does obeys the \cf+fill+
  mask, so the fill can be applied to a subset of the quantity (\eg a
  restricted height range) by issuing a \cf+Subset+ command first.  The
  \cf+dontMask+ flag instructs the program to ignore the mask.}
