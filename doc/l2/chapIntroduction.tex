The EOS Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) is one of four instruments on the
EOS Aura platform, to be launched in early 2004.  EOS MLS observes the
thermal microwave emission from the Earth's limb in several spectral
regions around 118, 190, 240, 640 and 2520\,GHz.  More details of EOS
MLS are given in \citet{EOSMLSOverview}.

\section{The role of the level 2 software}

The EOS MLS data, in common with other satellite observations are
divided into distinct `levels'.  Level~0 data describe raw instrument
telemetry.  Level~1 data\footnote{Note that unlike some instruments, EOS
  MLS does not have distinct Level 1A and 1B data} describe geolocated
and calibrated observations of radiance. Level~2 data are retrieved
geophysical parameters at locations corresponding to the measurement
footprint of the instrument. Level~3 data are retrieved geophysical
parameters on some fixed horizontal grid.

The level~2 data are generated by the level~2 software which takes the
calibrated radiances from the level~1 data and applies the `Retrieval
theory' methods \citep[for example]{Rodgers76} to obtain vertical
profiles of geophysical parameters.  Full details of the theoretical
aspects of the MLS level~2 software are given in
\citet{EOSMLSL2ATBD,EOSMLSFWMATBD}.
