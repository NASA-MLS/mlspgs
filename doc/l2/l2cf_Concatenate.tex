This command is used to concatenate gridded data together by date.
Typically it is used to combine operational data for two adjacent days
in that later interpolation (\eg fill method gridded) yields appropriate
results in the last `time slot' of the operational data.  The two grids
must be on identical coordinate systems, except for their dates, and grid
\cf+b+ must describe only times after the latest time described in grid \cf+a+.
If one of \cf+a+ or \cf+b+ are empty, the result is a copy of the
non-empty grid.  If both are empty the result is also empty.
