This fill method fills a vector quantity by interpolating a gridded
dataset in all the appropriate directions (temporal, horizontal,
vertical, solar time / zenith).  The grid would have been defined by a
\cf+gridded+ command in the \cf+readApriori+ section, or by a \cf+merge+
instruction in the \cf+mergeGrids+ section.  The vertical coordinate
types for the grid and the quantity have to match.  No other checking is
done to ensure that the fill is appropriate (\eg that you're not trying
to fill a temperature quantity with H\cs2O data).

By default the program will raise an error if any of the input gridded
data values used in the interpolation are missing or bad.  If the user
wishes to allow missing values in the resulting vector quantity (not
recommended), then set the \cf+allowMissing+ option.
