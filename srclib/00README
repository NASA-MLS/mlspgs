The files getCF.f90 and tree_checker.f90 have exactly the same source
text when used in L1, L2 and L3.  They depend, however, on
init_tables_module, which is different in those three contexts.

Therefore, getCF.f90 and tree_checker.f90 cannot be compiled and put
into the library ../lib/libmls.a.

The Makefiles for L1, L2 and L3 should refer to the sources here for
getCF.f90 and tree_checker.f90, and put the .o and .mod files in
their own directories.
