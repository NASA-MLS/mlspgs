#                 unique_name.sh    Returns a unique name
#
# Called by make to prevent multiple makes from attempting to write to same file
#
# Returns a unique name based on arg, PID and HOSTNAME
# e.g.,
#           temp_file_name=`unique_name.sh foo`
#           echo $temp_file_name
# might print foo.colossus.21455
# if no arg, defaults to "temp" (very original name)
# if two args present, assumes second is punctuation to
# use in place of "."
