========================= end mlsl2 =========================

The general pattern is to use upper-case letters for single-letter ones,
and lower-case letters for strings. Switches are case-sensitive.

The -S option sets the "switches" array in toggles_core.f90.
It's tested by "if ( index(switches,'foo') /= 0 ) then ..." so
you can put longer strings on the command line (so long as the rest
of it doesn't contain something you DON'T want to test for!).
 E.g. -Ssca could mean -Sscalars
but beware: literally setting -Sscalars may also turn on an unwanted switch,
"lars", causing mlsl2 to begin outputting all text in "Swedish Chef" mode
BORK! BORK! BORK!
(The above joke has fallen flat--
it is deprecated and may be removed in a future revision)

Let us clarify the requirement for adding new switches above:
if an existing switch is 'abc' don't add a new switch that contains
'abc' as a substring. Why? Because turning on your switch will
automatically turn on the existing 'abc' switch, too.

As of Oct 9 2003, we recommend separating switches with a comma rather
than catenating them. Thus to turn on both 'abc' and 'def', either use
-Sabc -Sdef or -S"abc,def". Among other good things, this prevents
accidentally turning on an unwanted 'cde' switch.

(Add any more that are relevant to mlsl2,
or separate sections for mlsl1 or mlsl3)

(The equal signs in the section dividers above are to help
sed dynamically update mlsl2 to show changes in the switch
usage automatically. Thus you only need to edit this file,
not MLSL2.f90)
