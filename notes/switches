========================= end mlsl2 =========================

The general pattern is to use upper-case letters for single-letter ones,
and lower-case letters for strings. Switches are case-sensitive.

The -S option sets the "switches" array in toggles_core.f90.
`
In only a few places, it's still tested by the older construct 
"if ( index(switches,'foo') /= 0 ) then ..." 

You can separate them either by preceding each with its own "-S" prefix or
else by commas in a single string. Thus to turn on both 'abc' and 'def',
either use -Sabc -Sdef or -S"abc,def". Among other good things, this
prevents accidentally turning on an unwanted 'cde' switch.

The MLSStringLists module contains a function SwitchDetail; assuming it
was called as SwitchDetail(switches, 'foo') it returns 
-1  means foo was not among switches
0   means foo or foo0 was one of the comma-separated switches
1   means foo1
2   means foo2
    .   .   .
Note that use of SwitchDetail requires separating the switches. It also
requires that you match the switch name precisely; e.g. if the switch is
"ab" but you forget, and so try to set "abc", you won't set "ab" after
all. The advantage is that by using SwitchDetail each switch is now
unique: you can have "foo", "bar", and "foobar" as three distinct
switches, confident that setting "foobar" won't inadvertently set the
other two.

Here's a trick for finding all the switches referred to by switchdetail in
our code so far:
cd ~/mlspgs
grep -i switchdetail */*.[fF]9* | grep -i 'switches' | sed 's/.*switches,//' \
 | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/)//' | sort | uniq

The same command, but replacing "switchdetail" with "index" will show all the 
switches referred to by the "index(switches, .." method.

(Add any more that are relevant to mlsl2,
or separate sections for mlsl1 or mlsl3)

(The equal signs in the section dividers above are to help
sed dynamically update mlsl2 to show changes in the switch
usage automatically. Thus you only need to edit this file,
not MLSL2.f90)
