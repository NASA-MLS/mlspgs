Switches (set by -S option in mlsl2's command line):

  A => AntennaPatterns
  C => SpectroscopyCatalog
  F => FilterShapes
  O => Open_init
  P => PointingGrids
  S => MLSSignals
  V => VGrids (in globalSettings)

  cho => How good was the Cholesky decomposition?
  col => Column scale vector for Newton iteration
  dvec => 'DX' vector during Newton iteration
  fac => Factors of normal equations during retriever iterations
  fvec => 'F' vector during Newton iteration
  glo => Global settings
  gvec => Gradient vector during Newton iteration
  jac => Jacobian during retriever iterations
  log => Log file messages
  pro => Product files: l2gp, l2aux, l2dgg, l2pc, meta
  neq => Normal equations during retriever iterations
  nwt => Action flag at each return from Newton solver
  rad => Radiances in ForwardModelInterface
  sca => Scalars of interest to the Newton method
  spa => Sparsity structure of fac, jac, neq
  svec => Final state vector after Newton iteration
  tps => Test_Parse_Signals
  xvec => 'X' vector during Newton iteration

The general pattern is to use upper-case letters for single-letter ones,
and lower-case letters for strings.

The -S option sets the "switches" array in toggles_core.f90.
It's tested by "if ( index(switches,'foo') /= 0 ) then ..." so
you can put longer strings on the command line (so long as the rest
of it doesn't contain something you DON'T want to test for!).  E.g.
-Ssca could be -Sscalars.

(Add any more that are relevant to mlsl2,
or separate sections for mlsl1 or mlsl3)
