Command line options:
   mlsl2 -slo1 -slo2 .. --mlo1 --mlo2 ..
where slon are single-letter options and mlon are multiletter options
E.g., mlsl2 -m -p --nmeta -S"glo,jac"
Note: use "-T2" and not "--T2" because T2 has one letter
========================= mlsl2 =========================
  -A: Dump the un-decorated abstract syntax tree.
  -a: Dump the decorated type-checked abstract syntax tree.
  -c: Trace expression evaluation and tree decoration.
  -d: Dump the declaration table after type checking
  -f[digit]: Trace Forward model.  Bigger digit means 
                    more output.
  -g[digit]: Trace "generation".  Bigger digit means 
                    more output.
  -h or -H or -?: This output.
  -l: Trace lexical analysis.
  -K: Case insensitive identifiers (default).
  -k: Case sensitive identifiers.
  -M: Send output through MLSMessage (default).
  -m: Don't send output through MLSMessage.
  -p: Trace parsing.
  -Sstring: Set "switches" = "string".  Characters in
            "string" may control individual outputs.  If -S is
            specified several times, the strings are combined.
     (For specific strings and their effects, use -S"?")
  -T[digit]: Time some processes depending on digit
     0: Time parsing, type checking and processing separately.
     1: like 0, and summarize times within Fill, Retrieve, etc. at end of run
     2: like 1, and show times within each section, too, as they happen
     3: like 2, and show cumulative times, too
  -t: Trace declaration table construction.
  -v: List the configuration file.
  The above options can be concatenated after one hyphen,
  except that -S takes the rest of the option as its "string"
  --check: Just check l2cf and quit
  --chunk[ ]<chunk index> Run just the <chunk index> chunk
    (repeat for 1st and last chunks in a range: 
      i.e., --chunk 1 --chunk 14 runs chunks 1..14)
  --[n]ckbk: Do [not] check the block calculations against full block algebra
  --[n]countChunks: Do [not] just print the number of chunks and quit
  --delay[ ]<amount> sleep <amount> micosecs at end of each master event loop
      default is 200000; 0 means no sleeping
  --fwmParallel: Run in forward model parallel mode.  Send each MAF of forward
    model calculations out to a slave.
  --[n]gcch: Do [not] force garbage collection after each chunk processed
  --[n]gcdt: Do [not] force garbage collection after each deallocate_test
  --[n]kit: Output error messages [not] using the SDP Toolkit
     (in the next 3, n may be one of {4, 5, b} where b means both 4 and 5)
  --l1b=n:   Assume hdfn when reading l1b files
  --l2gpr=n: Assume hdfeosn when reading l2gp files
  --l2gpw=n: Assume hdfeosn when writing l2gp files
  --master <filename>[:a:b]: This is the master task in a PVM setup
    filename contains simply ascii list of slave host names
    can list a machine more than once (e.g. for SMP slaves)
    One can also append, after a colon, a colon separated range
    of slaves within that file to use.
  --maxFailuresPerChunk[ ]<amount> abandon any chunk after <amount> failures
      scf default is 10; sips default is 1; 1 means allow no failures
  --maxFailuresPerMachine[ ]<amount> mark bad any machine after <amount> failures
      scf default is 1; sips default is 2; 1 means allow no failures
  --pge <commandname>: What to put on commandline instead of mlsl2
    when giving slaves their tasks (useful when using toolkit)
  --recl[ ]<number>: set the max record length size for l2cf to <number>
      (In case the default value, 20000, is too small for some l2cfs).
      This has effect only if the l2cf is not coming from standard input.
  --[n]skipRetr[ieval]: Do [not] skip all the Retrievals; a pre-flight checkout
  --slave[ ]<master-tid>: This is a slave; <master-tid>
    is the id of the master.  This option is set by a master
    task and is not recommended for manual invocations.
  --slaveMAF[ ]<number>: Set the MAF for a slave in fwmParallel mode.  This
    option is set by the master task, and is not recommended for manual
    invocations.
  --snoop: Activate the snooping capability (interaction with
    an IDL diagnostics process)
  --snoopname <name>: Distinguishing name to send to snooper (for use when
    using the stand alone logger)
  --stgmem: Tell parallel master task to stage in memory, as opposed to a file.
  --subblock <number>: Set the number of reals to consider when subblocking
    the matrix multiply
  --submit "command": In conjunction with --master, use the command
    to submit the slave task to a batch queue system.
  --[n]tk: [Do not] Use the panoply of the PGS_toolkit (pcf, metadata, etc.)
  --version: Print current version number
  --[n]wall: Use wall clock instead of CPU_TIME

  Options a, c, f0, g0, l, p and t can be toggled in the 
        configuration file
  by @A, @C, @E, @G, @L, @P and @S respectively.  @L and 
        @P are processed
  synchronously with the input.  The others are 
         examined later.
  @T in the configuration file dumps the string table 
         at that instant.
========================= end mlsl2 =========================

The general pattern is to use one dash for single-letter options,
and double dashes for strings.

(Add any more that are relevant to mlsl2,
or separate sections for mlsl1 or mlsl3)

(The equal signs in the section dividers above are to help
sed dynamically update mlsl2 to show changes in the option
usage automatically. Thus you only need to edit this file,
not MLSL2.f90. Add your changes to the space book-ended
by the equal-signs -- stuff outside that space, like these
comments, will not be printed in response to mlsl2 -?)
