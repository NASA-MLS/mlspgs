Command line options:
   mlsl2 -slo1 -slo2 .. --mlo1 --mlo2 ..
where slon are single-letter options and mlon are multiletter options
E.g., mlsl2 -m -p --nmeta -S"glo jac"
========================= mlsl2 =========================
  -A: Dump the un-decorated abstract syntax tree.
  -a: Dump the decorated type-checked abstract syntax tree.
  -c: Trace expression evaluation and tree decoration.
  -d: Dump the declaration table after type checking
  -f[digit]: Trace Forward model.  Bigger digit means 
                    more output.
  -g[digit]: Trace "generation".  Bigger digit means 
                    more output.
  -h or -H or -?: This output.
  -l: Trace lexical analysis.
  -K: Capitalize identifiers.
  -k: Don't capitalize identifiers.
  -M: Send output through MLSMessage.
  -m: Don't send output through MLSMessage.
  -p: Trace parsing.
  -Sstring: Set "switches" = "string".  Characters in
            "string" may control individual outputs.  If -S is
            specified several times, the strings are concatenated.
     (For specific strings and their effects, use -S"?")
  -T[digit]: Time some processes depending on digit
     0: Time parsing, type checking and processing separately.
     1: like 0, and summarize times within Fill, Retrieve, etc. at end of run
     2: like 1, and show times within each section, too, as they happen
     3: like 2, and show cumulative times, too
  -t: Trace declaration table construction.
  -v: List the configuration file.
  The above options can be concatenated after one hyphen,
  except that -S takes the rest of the option as its 
         "string"
  --[n]cfpcf: Open the L2CF [without] using the Toolkit 
        and the PCF.
      --ncfpcf assumed if L2CF-name is present.  
        Default: --cfpcf (SIPS) --ncfpcf (JPL)
  --[n]ckbk: Check the block calculations against full block algebra
  --[n]countChunks: Just print thenumber of chunks and quit
  --[n]kit: Output error messages [not] using the SDP Toolkit
  --[n]meta: [Do not] Create metadata files.
  --[n]pcf: [Do not] Use the PCF for file names, parameters, etc.
    (--npcf sets --nmeta and --ncfpcf.)
  --[n]tk: [Do not] Use the panoply of the PGS_toolkit
    (--ntk sets --npcf, --ncfpcf and --nmeta)
  --[n]wall: Use wall clock instead of CPU_TIME
  --master <filename>[:a:b]: This is the master task in a PVM setup
    filename contains simply ascii list of slave host names
    can list a machine more than once (e.g. for SMP slaves)
    One can also append, after a colon, a colon separated range
    of slaves with in that file to use.
  --slave[ ]<master-tid>: This is a slave; <master-tid>
    is the id of the master.  This option is set by a master
    task and is not recommneded for manual invocations.
  --snoop: Activate the snooping capability (interaction with
    an IDL diagnostics process)
    
  Options a, c, f0, g0, l, p and t can be toggled in the 
        configuration file
  by @A, @C, @E, @G, @L, @P and @S respectively.  @L and 
        @P are processed
  synchronously with the input.  The others are 
         examined later.
  @T in the configuration file dumps the string table 
         at that instant.
========================= end mlsl2 =========================

The general pattern is to use one dash for single-letter options,
and double dashes for strings.

(Add any more that are relevant to mlsl2,
or separate sections for mlsl1 or mlsl3)

(The equal signs in the section dividers above are to help
sed dynamically update mlsl2 to show changes in the option
usage automatically. Thus you only need to edit this file,
not MLSL2.f90)
