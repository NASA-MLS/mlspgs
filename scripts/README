* readl2gp.py - A module of one function, readl2gp, which mimics the
                behavior of the IDL routine readl2gpfile.pro.

		Requirements: Python version > 2.4 but less than
                3.0. PyTables (which itself requires Numpy)


		Inputs: filename[, swathname, variableName, PrecisionName]
		filename: required. Fully qualified name of L2GP file.

		swathName: optional: default=the first swath in the
                file. For all files named for individual species, this
                will be the data for that species, i.e. the 'standard
                product'. As of version 4x, (and for some files in
                3x), there are multiple swaths. To access these
                swaths, you must specify the name

		variableName: optional: default=L2gpValue for the
                indicated (or defaulted) swathName

		precisionName: optional: default=L2gpPrecision for the
                indicated (or defaulted) swathName
